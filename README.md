In this project, the approach of sentiment analysis is utilized to derive individual user perceptions about the different features of the new releases of two leading Smartphone brands - Vivo and Oppo. From the user comments and reviews on Twitter for the smartphones Vivo Nex and Oppo FindX, sentiments are classified and using the sentiment classification the different features such as Camera, display etc are compared to determine which brand has better acceptance among customers.

Dataset: Software(anonymous) used to download twitter data for hashtags #VivoNex and #OppoFindX

- Processed data folder contains twitter data for the two hashtags after preliminary data processing (such as removing retweets)

- Codes folder contain R code for sentiment analysis and comparison
